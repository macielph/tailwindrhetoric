Promotional Video for Podcast Episode 115 on Pizzagate
</h1>
    <div class="excerpt">
        <p class="font-serif text-lg">Canary Cry Radio is a podcast that produces content on various conspiracy theories from a Christian point of view. Episode 115 of Canary Cry Radio aired on February 20, 2017, titled “#Pizzagate is Real with Titus Frost.” Joining Gonz, the host of episode 115, is Titus Frost, a YouTube personality that made a series of video essays on the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. Pizzagate was a popular conspiracy theory that gained traction during the 2016 United States presidential election and is now combined with the QAnon conspiracy, which is gaining traction during the 2020 election. Pizzagate claims that many leaders in the democratic party are linked to a pedophilia ring. The promotional video for episode 115 was uploaded onto the YouTube channel, “FaceLikeTheSun.” Currently, the channel has 263,000 subscribers. Canary Cry Radio’s main point with this episode is that people need to know more about Pizzagate and the people involved with it. Gonz and Titus Frost attempt to convince their audience that Pizzagate is true and needs to be known through their use of facts and emotional influence.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">The purpose of the promotional video for episode 115 of Canary Cry Radio is to spark interest in the subject to convince people that Pizzagate has validity so the audience will watch the entire podcast. This video was made clearly stating their point of view on the subject. The video starts to list names of political figures that are connected to the Clinton’s and pedophilia as stated in the video, “It may be pertinent to point out here that Hillary and Bill Clinton have a laundry list of cohorts and associates that have been busted for child trafficking or pedophilia.” (Radio, 2017). The speaker then proceeds to list said cohorts and associates and their links to trafficking and pedophilia.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">An example of Canary Cry Radio’s position is the link between Jeffery Epstein and the Clinton’s. The speaker brings up Epstein’s “Black Book” which links Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, and Prince Andrew to Epstein. The speaker also mentions that Epstein has been proven guilty of soliciting prostitution with a minor and paid families of the victims. This is an appeal to the audience’s logic or and appeal to logos. The speaker states Epstein to be a pedophile and alleged child trafficker and then states that Bill Clinton had visited Epstein’s private island, which was claimed to be a grounds for trafficking. The audience is lead to believe that if Bill Clinton was associated with Epstein that he must have been involved with child trafficking. This is an example of a logical fallacy because Bill Clinton isn’t necessarily involved with child trafficking and pedophilia just due to him visiting Epstein’s island. Bill Clinton could have been associated with Epstein for financial reasons.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">The video shows a very clear opinion of this is when the speaker talks about the death of Monica Petersen. In the video, it states, “Another very interesting connection to the Clinton’s and the Clinton Foundation is Monica Petersen. Monica Petersen was the assistant director of the Human Trafficking Center who worked in Haiti and it is been claimed that she had been highly critical of the Clinton Foundation and their possible role in child trafficking.” (Radio, 2017). This is another example of an appeal to logos. The speaker brings up Monica Petersen’s suspicions that the Clinton’s were involved in human trafficking. The audience is then lead to believe that because of this connection her death may have been linked to her suspicions of the Clinton’s. This is another logical fallacy because there is no evidence linking Monica Petersen’s death to the Clinton’s.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">To help support Frost and Gonz’s claim, throughout the video tense, ominous music can be heard playing. This is an example of an appeal to pathos, or the use of emotion to persuade someone. In a blog post written by Victoria Blow on the Longwood University website, it states, “Starting with Pathos, music can be almost synonymous with it. As mentioned earlier, music can evoke a wide range of emotions and can completely change the tone of any situation.” Music has the ability to add suspense, love, or hate by just adding it to the background of a video. This video uses the music to evoke tension in the audience and to help convey the message Canary Cry Radio is trying to perceive as serious and not a joke.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">In addition, the way the speakers convey themselves makes there argument more convincing. This is an example of an appeal to ethos. Due to the speakers sounding very composed it makes the audience believe that they know what they’re talking about. To help convey this the audio quality throughout the video is also very effective in adding to the validity of the speakers. Another example of the appeal to ethos is the popularity of the channel the video is posted on, FaceLikeTheSun. The channel is very large with over 263,000 subscribers. People tend to trust a more popular channel rather than a smaller one when it comes to persuading someone.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">Overall, the Canary Cry Radio uses many rhetorical appeals to attempt to convince the audience that Pizzagate is true.  The video makes good claims and allows the audience to make connections themselves instead of explicitly stating the ties. The video effectively uses rhetorical tools to attempt to convince the audience of the message and the possible validity of Pizzagate.
