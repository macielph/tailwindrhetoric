    <div class="excerpt">
        <p class="font-serif text-lg">The first reported case of COVID-19 was on December 31, 2019, in Wuhan, China. After the novel coronavirus had spread to other countries, the first reported cases of COVID-19 were on January 20, 2020. The United States had begun taking precautionary measures, including a travel ban from China, where most cases were being reported. As research on COVID-19 had begun, many United States citizens had started to take their own measures to protect themselves and others from COVID-19. The public listened and watched closely as the country began to shut down due to fear of spreading COVID-19 and causing massive overflow in hospitals as people began to die. One of the primary forms of personal protection is the face mask. As the pandemic spread throughout the country, many Americans began taking after other countries in wearing masks to prevent spreading the virus. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that every American wear a facemask when in public settings. As cases continue to rise, the United States government should require masks to be worn in public settings across the entire country.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">Wearing a mask helps to prevent COVID-19 from spreading through the air. The Center for disease control and the World Health Organization recommends people to wear cloth masks. An experiment was done using slow-motion video to determine how many droplets are generated from a human when speaking. It was found hundreds of droplets were expelled when saying a phrase. Almost every drop was blocked when a damp washcloth covered the mouth. In another experiment, using subjects who had influenza found wearing a surgical mask drastically limited the amount of the virus that was emitted in droplets and aerosols.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">Another study compared the COVID-19 growth rate before and after states started to mandate mask use. The study found that mask mandates equated to a much slower growth rate of COVID-19. Another study showed that countries with government policies favoring mask-wearing had lower death rates than those without mask mandates.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">A model developed by the Colorado COVID-19 Modeling Group predicts that masks reduce the wearer’s contagiousness by 50%. It also shows that if everyone wore masks, statewide ICU bed occupancy wouldn’t exceed 406, and if no one wore a mask, the ICU bed occupancy would hit 2969 by January.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">Another reason masks are preferred to alternate measures is because of the low-cost of masks. As of October 26, 2020, there have been a total of 463,529 people hospitalized by COVID-19. In America, hospital stays are extremely expensive, with a night at the ICU costing an average of 10,794 dollars. Americans are asked to wear masks by the CDC and the WHO to help prevent spreading the virus. At Walmart, you can buy a pair of reusable face masks for 7 dollars. Americans have to decide where they would prefer to spend their money.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">Wearing a mask is also incredibly easy and convenient, with most masks just requiring you to loop the straps of the mask around your ears. When entering a public place, you put your mask on and keep your distance from others as best as possible, and then when you leave the public place you can take your mask off. Masks are also very light and flexible, allowing most masks to fit into any sized pocket ready to be used whenever needed.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">Wearing a mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19 will benefit the economy. Lockdowns are an emergency measure to stop the spread of the virus. According to a review article by Jeremy Howard, the impact of masks could save thousands of US dollars per person per mask. The amount of economic destruction that has already happened is terrible.  Goldman Sachs estimates that masks could prevent the need for lockdowns. They estimate that lockdowns could wipe out 5% of GDP, equal to about 1.027 trillion dollars.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">As state and local governments began to require masks to prevent the spread of the virus, many Americans refused or expressed their opinion on whether the government should be able to mandate masks. Throughout the pandemic, one of the most common arguments for why you shouldn’t wear a mask is because government mandates not to wear a mask is infringing on people’s freedoms. I’ve heard the argument that if the government can force us to wear masks, they will force Americans to do other things, from multiple people.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">As conspiracy theories and revolt against wearing masks grew, many state and local governments began to battle with these individuals and refuted their arguments. State and local governments actually hold a lot of power when it comes to public emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic, specifically with issuing emergency orders. For example, the Governor of California issued a mask mandate that requires Californians to wear masks in most public places and settings. Residents and local officials criticized the Governor’s mandate. They argued that the governor couldn’t make wearing a mask in public settings a requirement. According to Lindsay Wiley, the director of the Health Law and Policy Program at American University, the governor is legally allowed to create and enforce mask mandates. Business owners are also legally allowed to refuse service to someone not wearing a mask or face-covering in the same way they can refuse service to someone not wearing shoes.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">Mask wearing has become very political, as well. With one of the arguments of mask mandates being individual freedoms, wearing a mask has also been related to political affiliation. Research by the Pew Research Center shows that Republicans and Democrats are growing further apart in COVID-19 concerns. Most people say that people’s actions affect the spread of the virus; while 73% of Democrats believe this, only 44% of Republicans say the same. Democrats are also about twice as likely to believe masks should be worn in public places where close contact with others is possible than republicans.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">The political divide of mask-wearing has raised tension between scientists and doctors, and the public. The COVID-19 pandemic isn’t the first example of this happening. Seat belt laws, motorcycle helmet laws, and rules about who can sell cigarettes and where you can smoke them are examples of public health rules becoming political. All of these rules have been passed and are still in effect, so can mask mandates break the political affiliation as well?
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">Another reason people refuse to wear masks or are against mandates is because of lots of mixed messaging. During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic Center for Disease Control and Prevention told the public that healthy people didn’t need to wear masks. Soon after, on April 3, the CDC reversed their earlier statement and advised everyone, healthy or not, to wear a cloth face mask or covering in public. President Donald Trump and many members of his cabinet also chose not to wear facemasks as well. In addition, it is incredibly easy to find a large amount of information on why not to wear face masks. After doing a google search on “why to not wear a mask” I found an article titled “Why I’m Not Wearing A Mask.” The article is filled with lots of information on why wearing a mask is potentially useless and possibly harmful.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">Since the beginning of the pandemic, every day, scientists are researching COVID-19 and how it spreads. When the CDC issued their initial statement on facemasks, information on how the virus spreads were not as known as it is today. It’s now evident that wearing a mask will help prevent COVID-19 from spreading through the air. Many states are now issuing their own mandates forcing the public to wear face masks.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif text-lg">Every day more people are dying due to COVID-19. Many state governments are adopting mask mandates, but the federal government has not acted on a mask mandate for the country. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, in states where governments will not require masks to be worn in public, the federal government must pass a law to require masks in public settings.
